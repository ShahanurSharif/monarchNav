# MonarchNav v2.2.4 Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 30, 2025  
**Version:** 2.2.4  
**Package:** `monarch-nav-theme.sppkg`

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Logo Display Issue Resolution
- **Fixed:** Empty logo URLs no longer display broken image icons
  - When `logoUrl` is empty or contains only whitespace, logo section is completely hidden
  - Prevents broken image display that occurred with empty logo configuration
  - Clean, professional appearance when no logo is configured

### 2. Theme Settings Logo Preview Enhancement
- **Improved:** Logo preview in theme settings now handles empty states properly
  - Shows "No Logo Set" placeholder when no logo is configured
  - Only displays actual logo image when valid logo URL is present
  - Delete button only appears when a logo is actually set
  - Better user experience in theme configuration

---

## Technical Details

### Logo Display Logic
```typescript
// Container.tsx - Only render logo when URL exists
{(config.themes.logoUrl && config.themes.logoUrl.trim() !== "") && (
    <a href={props.context.pageContext.web.absoluteUrl}>
        <img src={config.themes.logoUrl} alt="Logo" />
    </a>
)}

// ThemeModal.tsx - Conditional logo preview
{config.themes.logoUrl && config.themes.logoUrl.trim() !== "" ? (
    // Show actual logo with delete button
) : (
    // Show "No Logo Set" placeholder
)}
```

### Code Changes
- **Container.tsx**: Added conditional rendering for logo section
- **ThemeModal.tsx**: Enhanced logo preview with empty state handling
- **Removed**: Unused `getSiteUrl` function from ThemeModal
- **Improved**: TypeScript compilation with no unused variable warnings

---

## User Benefits

### For Administrators:
- **Clean Interface**: No broken image icons when logo is not configured
- **Better UX**: Clear indication in theme settings when no logo is set
- **Professional Appearance**: Navigation header looks polished even without logo

### For End Users:
- **Consistent Experience**: Navigation always displays correctly regardless of logo configuration
- **No Visual Clutter**: Clean interface without broken image placeholders

---

## Migration Notes

### Automatic Migration:
- Existing configurations with empty logo URLs will now display cleanly
- No broken images will appear in navigation header
- All existing theme settings preserved

### Configuration Impact:
- Empty `logoUrl` values now result in no logo display (instead of broken image)
- Users must explicitly set a logo URL to display a logo
- Default logo fallback removed for cleaner implementation

---
