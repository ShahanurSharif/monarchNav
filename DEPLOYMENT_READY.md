# MonarchNav Deployment Ready - All Issues Fixed

## Summary
The MonarchNav SharePoint Framework extension has been successfully fixed and is now ready for deployment. All previous deployment issues have been resolved.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸ”§ **Critical Build Issue**
- **Problem**: TypeScript compilation was placing files in `lib/src/extensions/` instead of `lib/extensions/`
- **Solution**: Updated `config/config.json` entrypoint path to match actual output location
- **Result**: Bundle creation now works correctly

### ðŸ”§ **Deployment Configuration Issue**  
- **Problem**: `skipFeatureDeployment: false` required manual site-level installation
- **Solution**: Changed to `skipFeatureDeployment: true` in `package-solution.json`
- **Result**: Enables automatic tenant-wide deployment

### ðŸ”§ **Error Handling Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Extension could fail silently if configuration files were missing
- **Solution**: Added robust fallback configuration and error handling in `MonarchNavApplicationCustomizer.ts`
- **Result**: Extension displays basic navigation even if config loading fails

### ðŸ”§ **Testing Infrastructure**
- **Problem**: Jest and Playwright configurations had conflicts
- **Solution**: Separated Jest unit tests from Playwright e2e tests, added proper TypeScript support
- **Result**: All 5 unit tests pass successfully

### ðŸ”§ **Component Structure**
- **Problem**: Missing data-testid for e2e testing
- **Solution**: Added `data-testid="monarch-nav-root"` to main container
- **Result**: E2e tests can now locate the extension properly
