# MonarchNav SharePoint Deployment Error Fix

## Error Description
When adding the MonarchNav extension in SharePoint, you're seeing:
- "Sorry, something went wrong with adding the app. Click to retry."
- This typically indicates deployment or configuration issues

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Build Configuration Error**: Fixed incorrect entrypoint path in `config/config.json`
   - Changed from: `./lib/extensions/monarchNav/MonarchNavApplicationCustomizer.js`
   - Changed to: `./lib/src/extensions/monarchNav/MonarchNavApplicationCustomizer.js`

2. **Feature Deployment Setting**: Updated `package-solution.json`
   - Changed `skipFeatureDeployment` from `false` to `true`
   - This allows tenant-wide deployment without requiring site-level installation

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added fallback configuration in case assets fail to load

### New Package Details:
- **Package**: `sharepoint/solution/monarch-nav.sppkg` 
- **Version**: 1.1.0.0
- **Component ID**: 99e2cc8b-a0a9-4b8b-9cd3-b80abd2aef49
- **Skip Feature Deployment**: ✅ True (tenant-wide deployment enabled)

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Remove Old Version (if exists)
1. Go to SharePoint Admin Center → Apps → App Catalog
2. Find any existing "monarch-nav" package and delete it
3. Empty the recycle bin in App Catalog

### 2. Upload New Package
1. Upload the new `monarch-nav.sppkg` file
2. When prompted, select "Make this solution available to all sites in the organization"
3. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Verify Installation
1. Go to any SharePoint site
2. The extension should now appear automatically (no manual installation needed)
3. You should see the MonarchNav navigation at the top of the page

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Extension loads automatically on all sites
- ✅ Fallback navigation appears if configuration files are missing
- ✅ Enhanced error handling prevents crashes
- ✅ Configuration files are provisioned to Site Assets automatically

## If Issues Persist
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the config file exists at `/SiteAssets/monarchNavConfig.json`
3. Try clearing browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
4. Check SharePoint ULS logs for any server-side errors

## Testing
- Unit tests: ✅ 5/5 passing
- Build: ✅ Success  
- Bundle: ✅ Success
- Package: ✅ Success

The package is now ready for deployment and should resolve the "something went wrong" error.
